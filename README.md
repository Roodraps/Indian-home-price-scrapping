# Indian-home-price-scrapping

# Motivation Behind the scrapping
Here I am performing the scrapping from one of the Good Indian website named as housing.com this is showing the prices of the houses of particular city and the prices changes according to area to area. Here I have scrapped the mumbai city data like Price of the house and EMI have to pay per month, location of the house, possesion status, price per square fit (according to the location). This will to make the app that will predict the houses of the indian city according to the location size of the housing and many more factors. I have scrapped data because people doing data analysis of foreign home prices and doing the prediction but no one is doing for our country India. I hope this is going to benifitted to predict the home prices of indian cities.

 
# we can scrap any city data by following below process
It will give home prices in csv file of different-2 locations. 
This scrapping is happening from the website name: '' housing.com''
and when we search housing.com, it will navigate to that page and search the city where you want to take the home. copy the url paste in the app and we will get whole details of regarding price of the house,EMI that we have to pay,Price per square feet,exact location and many more.

# what This will scrap ?
1. Price of the house and EMI have to pay per month
2. location of the house
